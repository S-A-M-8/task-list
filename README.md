# This is a single-page web application designed to facilitate CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations within a task management framework.

Users can seamlessly create tasks by providing input, read, and search through existing tasks after enabling the search task switch. They can update specific list items by using the user-friendly edit button and delete task entries according to user preferences. The application is designed to display toast notifications at the bottom of the page, ensuring users receive real-time feedback whenever a task is added, updated, or deleted.
